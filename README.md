# My friends
my best friend, best friend til the very end
Wherever you go, just always remember
That you got a home for now and forever
And if you get low, just call me whenever
This is my oath to you
Wherever you go, just always remember
You never alone, we’re birds of a feather
And we’ll never change, no matter the weather
This is my oath to you
To my imaginary friend..
